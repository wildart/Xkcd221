## Usage

In your tests, simply initialize an RNG with a given seed, and use it instead of the default provided one, e.g.

```julia
julia> using Xkcd221

julia> rng = Xkcd221RNG()
Xkcd221RNG(0x0000000000000004)

julia> rand(rng, Int)
4

julia> rand(rng, Int, 3, 3)
3Ã—3 Matrix{Int64}:
 4  4  4
 4  4  4
 4  4  4 
```
